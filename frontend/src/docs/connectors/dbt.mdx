# dbt Connector

The dbt connector allows you to integrate your dbt (Data Build Tool) projects directly into SynqX pipelines. This enables a hybrid workflow where SynqX handles data ingestion (ETL) and dbt handles complex in-warehouse transformations (ELT).

## Configuration

When creating a new dbt connection, you need to provide:

| Field            | Description                                                                     |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Project Path`   | The local filesystem path to your dbt project (used by local or remote agents). |
| `Git URL`        | The repository URL to clone your project from.                                  |
| `Target Profile` | The dbt profile target to use (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).                            |

## Features

### Asset Discovery

SynqX automatically parses your dbt `manifest.json` to discover all models defined in your project. These models appear as available assets in the SynqX UI.

### Integrated Execution

You can use the **dbt Command** operator in the Pipeline Builder to trigger specific dbt actions:

- `dbt run`: Build your models.
- `dbt test`: Validate your data.
- `dbt seed`: Load CSV files into your warehouse.

## High-Performance Runtimes

SynqX manages isolated Python virtual environments for dbt. When a dbt task is triggered, the agent ensures that the correct version of `dbt-core` and the required database adapters are installed and used, preventing dependency conflicts with other pipeline tasks.
